=head1 SYNOPSIS

    #!/usr/bin/perl -w
    use strict;

    # Use POEny!
    use Acme::POE::Knee;

    # Every Acme::POE::Knee race will require a set of arguments.
    # There are defaults but it's just more fun to set these
    # yourselves. We set a distance the ponies must run and of course
    # we name our race ponies! You'll have to specify the maximum
    # delay a pony can have before reaching the next stage.
    # The lower the delay, the higher the chances are the pony will
    # win the race.

    my $pony = new Acme::POE::Knee (
	      dist   => 20,
        ponies  => {
            'dngor'     => 5,
            'Abigail'   => 5.2,
            'Co-Kane'   => 5.4,
            'MJD'       => 5.6,
            'acme'      => 5.8,
        },
    );

    # start the race
    $pony->race( );

    exit;


=head1 QUICK LINKS

Please see the samples directory in POE's distribution for several
well-commented sample and tutorial programs.

Please see <http://www.perl.com/pub/2001/01/poe.html> for an excellent,
and more importantly: gradual, introduction to POE.


=head1 DESCRIPTION

POE::Knee is an acronym of "Pony".  We all like ponies. And wouldn't we
love to race ponies? Well, that's what Acme::POE::Knee is for!

It's great for those friday afternoons at the office, where you wonder
who will pay the beer tab. Whoever 'wins' the race, loses!

You specify a distance the ponies must run, and a maximum delay before
the pony will reach the next step. So, the bigger the delay, the bigger
the distance between multiple ponies can be.

Of course this wouldn't be any fun if we couldn't name the ponies
ourselves. Here, we simply put all our race ponies in an array
reference and the Acme::POE::Knee module will take care of the rest.


=head1 USING Acme::POE::Knee

Using Acme::POE::Knee is really easy.
This simple progam would already suffice:

    use strict;
    use Acme::POE::Knee;

    my $pony = new Acme::POE::Knee;
    $pony->race();
    exit;

This will use the defaults of the POE::Knee module, but you can of
course specify your own arguments, as shown in the synopsis.


=head1 The Use of Acme::POE::Knee

Use, yes... Usefull? Probably not. This was written in response to a
rather persistant meme on #perl (you know who you are!).
Basicly, we all wanted ponies.
Well folks, here it is.

Its source might be interesting to look at for newcomers to POE to see
how this time slicing works.
